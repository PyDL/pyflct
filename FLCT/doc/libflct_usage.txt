USER'S GUIDE TO THE FLCT LIBRARY

Starting with version 1.03 of flct and warp, the mathematical/computational 
tasks have been placed in a series of functions that are separate from the main
programs, which are now mainly assigned to do the I/O operations, and then
call the flct, flct_pc, shift_frac2d, or warp_frac2d functions.  These functions
can also be called independently from other Fortran or C programs by linking to
the flct library.  In this document, we
describe how to call these functions from either C or Fortran.  The flct
library of functions is written entirely in C, but contains function 
wrappers which allow for subroutine calls from a Fortran program.

The flct function computes a 2-d velocity field from two images
that are separated slightly in time.  The flct_pc function does the same
task as the flct function, but assumes the two images are given on a Plate
Carree grid (uniformly spaced in longitude and latitude).  
The shift_frac2d function performs a 
uniform shift on an image, and the warp_frac2d function will perform a 
non-uniform shift (i.e. a "warp") of an image.

From either C or Fortran, the flct, flct_pc, shift_frac2d, or warp_frac2d 
functions will require that the calling program also link to the fftw3 
library as well as the flct library.

When using gcc to link to flct and fftw3, typical linking options would be 
-lflct -lfftw3 -lm.  Make sure that flctsubs.h is installed in a location
that the compiler will find.  

When linking with gfortran, typical linking options would
be -lflct -lfftw3.  

Note that when building the flct library, the default is to assume that complex
variables in C are not defined.  See the README-install.txt file in the source
folder for instructions on how to compile in support for complex variables in C
if you need it.

i4 flct (i4 transp, double * f1, double * f2, i4 nx, i4 ny, double deltat, 
    double deltas, double sigma, double * vx, double * vy, double * vm,
    double thresh, i4 absflag, i4 filter, double kr, i4 skip,
    i4 poffset, i4 qoffset, i4 interpolate, i4 biascor, i4 verbose)

PURPOSE:  To use local-correlation tracking to find a 2D velocity field from
          two images separated slightly in time.

USAGE: iflct=flct(transp, f1, f2, nx, ny, deltat, deltas, sigma, 
       vx, vy, vm, thresh, absflag, filter, kr, skip, poffset, qoffset, 
       interpolate, biascor, verbose);

transp:        (input) 4-byte integer indicating whether input images are stored
               in column-major (1st index varies fastest) or row-major
               (2nd index varies fastest) order.  Typically, 2D-images
               constructed in IDL or Fortran are stored in column-major order.
               If (transp == 0) then row-major order is assumed, but if
               (transp == 1) column major order is assumed.

f1:            (input) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the first of the images to be operated on by the 
               flct function.

f2:            (input) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny 
               containing the second of the images to be operated on by the 
               flct function.

nx:            (input) 4-byte integer containing the number of pixels in 
               x direction across the image

ny:            (input) 4-byte integer containing the number of pixels in 
               y direction across the image

deltat:        (input) double precision value of the time between images

deltas:        (input) double precision value of the distance across one edge
               of a pixel

sigma:         (input) double precision value of the Gaussian windowing function
               used to localize regions of the image near a given pixel.  Sigma
               is measured in pixels.  If sigma is set to 0, then flct returns
               a whole frame shift, rather than a 2-D velocity field.

vx:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the x-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma == 0.) then only one value
               of vx is computed.

vy:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the y-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma == 0.) then only one value
               of vy is computed.

vm:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing a mask, set to 0 if no velocity was computed, 
               set to 1 if the velocity was computed, and set to 0.5 if
               the velocity was interpolated.  If (sigma == 0.) then only one
               value of vm is returned.

thresh:        (input) double precision value of the image threshold, where no
               estimate of the velocity will be done if the absolute value of
               the average image value is less than thresh.  If thresh is
               between 0 and 1, then the threshold is assumed to be in units
               relative to the maximum absolute value (unless absflag !=0).

absflag:       (input) 4-byte integer flag value:  If (absflag !=0) and 
               thresh is between 0 and 1, then thresh is regarded as an 
               absolute limit, rather a relative limit.

filter:        (input) 4-byte integer flag value:  If (filter !=0) then high
               frequency spatial components of the images are attenuated by a 
               Gaussian low-pass filter.  Filtering can be useful if there is
               a lot of high frequency noise in the images.

kr:            (input) double precision filter value.  If (filter !=0) then 
               kr determines the amount of high spatial-frequency filtering of 
               the images.  Smaller values of kr result in stronger filtering.
               We have found useful values are in the range 0.25 to 0.5.  Values
               larger than 1.0 typically have little effect, and values 0.1
               and smaller typically result in too much filtering.

skip:          (input) 4-byte integer value specifying how many pixels to 
               skip between velocity calculations.  If (skip ==0) no skipping 
               is done.  Setting skip to 2 means to skip every other pixel 
               in both the x and y directions.  This option is useful when 
               working with very large images, and also where interpolation 
               is done (see discussion of "interpolate" below).  

poffset:       (input) 4-byte integer value specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the x-direction if skipping is invoked.

qoffset:       (input) 4-byte integer value specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the y-direction if skipping is invoked.

interpolate:   (input) 4-byte integer value of interpolate flag.  If skip is 
               non-zero, and if (interpolate !=0) the
               velocities at the skipped pixels are interpolated by using
               cubic convolution interpolation, by using the pixels where the
               velocity has been computed.  This option can be useful for
               very large images, and where skip is less than sigma.  The 
               mask array vm is set to 0.5 at the locations where the velocity 
               components are interpolated.

biascor:       (input) 4-byte integer value of the "bias-correction" flag.
               if(biascor != 0) then the flct velocities are "bias corrected"
               by attempting to correct for the fact that the gaussian window
               function is the same for both the initial and final images,
               resulting in a velocity under-estimate using the standard
               FLCT algorithm.  

verbose:       (input) 4-byte integer value of the verbosity flag.  
               If (verbose ==0) then flct messages to stdout are suppressed.

    i4 poffset, i4 qoffset, i4 interpolate, double latmin, double latmax,
    i4 biascor, i4 verbose)

PURPOSE:  To use local-correlation tracking to find a 2D velocity field from
          two images separated slightly in time.  The images are assumed to
          be in Plate Carree coordinates (equally spaced in longitude and
          latitude).  The images are interpolated to a Mercator grid, flct
          is run, and the velocities are interpolated back to a Plate Carree
          grid, with a cos(latitude) modulation of the velocity amplitude.
          The interpolation method used is cubic convolution.

USAGE: iflct=flct_pc(transp, f1, f2, nx, ny, deltat, deltas, sigma, 
       vx, vy, vm, thresh, absflag, filter, kr, skip, poffset, qoffset, 
       interpolate, latmin, latmax, biascor, verbose);

transp:        (input) 4-byte integer indicating whether input images are stored
               in column-major (1st index varies fastest) or row-major
               (2nd index varies fastest) order.  Typically, 2D-images
               constructed in IDL or Fortran are stored in column-major order.
               If (transp == 0) then row-major order is assumed, but if
               (transp == 1) column major order is assumed.

f1:            (input) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the first of the images to be operated on by the 
               flct function.

f2:            (input) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny 
               containing the second of the images to be operated on by the 
               flct function.

nx:            (input) 4-byte integer containing the number of pixels in 
               x direction across the image

ny:            (input) 4-byte integer containing the number of pixels in 
               y direction across the image

deltat:        (input) double precision value of the time between images

deltas:        (input) double precision value of the distance across one edge
               of a pixel

sigma:         (input) double precision value of the Gaussian windowing function
               used to localize regions of the image near a given pixel.  Sigma
               is measured in pixels.  If sigma is set to 0, then flct returns
               a whole frame shift, rather than a 2-D velocity field.

vx:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the x-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma == 0.) then only one value
               of vx is computed.

vy:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing the y-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma == 0.) then only one value
               of vy is computed.

vm:            (output) pointer to a double precision array of size nx*ny
               containing a mask, set to 0 if no velocity was computed, 
               and set to 0.5 if the velocity was interpolated.  
               If (sigma == 0.) then only one
               value of vm is returned.  Note that because flct_pc uses
               interpolation, no value of 1.0 is ever returned into vm
               from flct_pc. 

thresh:        (input) double precision value of the image threshold, where no
               estimate of the velocity will be done if the absolute value of
               the average image value is less than thresh.  If thresh is
               between 0 and 1, then the threshold is assumed to be in units
               relative to the maximum absolute value (unless absflag !=0).

absflag:       (input) 4-byte integer flag value:  If (absflag !=0) and 
               thresh is between 0 and 1, then thresh is regarded as an 
               absolute limit, rather a relative limit.

filter:        (input) 4-byte integer flag value:  If (filter !=0) then high
               frequency spatial components of the images are attenuated by a 
               Gaussian low-pass filter.  Filtering can be useful if there is
               a lot of high frequency noise in the images.

kr:            (input) double precision filter value.  If (filter !=0) then 
               kr determines the amount of high spatial-frequency filtering of 
               the images.  Smaller values of kr result in stronger filtering.
               We have found useful values are in the range 0.25 to 0.5.  Values
               larger than 1.0 typically have little effect, and values 0.1
               and smaller typically result in too much filtering.

skip:          (input) 4-byte integer value specifying how many pixels to 
               skip between velocity calculations.  If (skip ==0) no skipping 
               is done.  Setting skip to 2 means to skip every other pixel 
               in both the x and y directions.  This option is useful when 
               working with very large images, and also where interpolation 
               is done (see discussion of "interpolate" below).  For flct_pc,
               interpolate must be non-zero if skip is selected, or the
               function will exit.

poffset:       (input) 4-byte integer value specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the x-direction if skipping is invoked.

qoffset:       (input) 4-byte integer value specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the y-direction if skipping is invoked.

interpolate:   (input) 4-byte integer value of interpolate flag.  If skip is 
               non-zero, and if (interpolate !=0) the
               velocities at the skipped pixels are interpolated by using
               cubic convolution interpolation, by using the pixels where the
               velocity has been computed.  This option can be useful for
               very large images, and where skip is less than sigma.  The 
               mask array vm is set to 0.5 at the locations where the velocity 
               components are interpolated.

latmin:        (input) double precision value of the minimum latitude of the

biascor:       (input) 4-byte integer value of the "bias-correction" flag.
               if(biascor != 0) then the flct velocities are "bias corrected"
               by attempting to correct for the fact that the gaussian window
               function is the same for both the initial and final images,

               FLCT algorithm.

verbose:       (input) 4-byte integer value of the verbosity flag.  
               If (verbose ==0) then flct messages to stdout are suppressed.

               pixel.  Sigma is measured in pixels.  If sigma is set to 0, 
               then flct returns a whole frame shift, rather than a 2-D 
               velocity field.

vx:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing the x-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one value
               of vx is computed.

vy:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing the y-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one value
               of vy is computed.

vm:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing a mask, set to 0 if no velocity was computed, 
               set to 1 if the velocity was computed, and set to 0.5 if
               the velocity was interpolated.  If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one
               value of vm is returned.

thresh:        (input) real*8 variable of the image threshold, where no
               estimate of the velocity will be done if the absolute value of
               the average image value is less than thresh.  If thresh is
               between 0 and 1, then the threshold is assumed to be in units
               relative to the maximum absolute value (unless absflag .ne. 0).

absflag:       (input) integer*4 variable:  If (absflag .ne. 0) and 
               thresh is between 0 and 1, then thresh is regarded as an 
               absolute limit, rather a relative limit.

filter:        (input) integer*4 flag variable:  If (filter .ne. 0) then high
               frequency spatial components of the images are attenuated by a 
               Gaussian low-pass filter.  Filtering can be useful if there is
               a lot of high frequency noise in the images.

kr:            (input) real*8 variable.  If (filter .ne. 0) then 
               kr determines the amount of high spatial-frequency filtering of 
               the images.  Smaller values of kr result in stronger filtering.
               We have found useful values are in the range 0.25 to 0.5.  Values
               of kr larger than 1.0 typically have little effect, and values 
               0.1 and smaller typically result in too much filtering.

skip:          (input) integer*4 variable specifying how many pixels to 
               skip between velocity calculations.  If (skip .eq. 0) no 
               skipping is done.  Setting skip to 2 means to skip every other 
               pixel in both the x and y directions.  This option is useful 
               when working with very large images, and also where interpolation
               is done (see discussion of "interpolate" below).  

poffset:       (input) integer*4 variable specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the x-direction if skipping is invoked.

qoffset:       (input) integer*4 variable specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the y-direction if skipping is invoked.

interpolate:   (input) integer*4 variable, the interpolate flag.  If skip is 
               non-zero, and if (interpolate .ne. 0) the
               velocities at the skipped pixels are interpolated by using
               cubic convolution interpolation, by using the pixels where the
               velocity has been computed.  This option can be useful for
               very large images, and where skip is less than sigma.  The 
               mask array vm is set to 0.5 at the locations where the velocity 
               components are interpolated.

biascor:       (input) integer*4 variable, the "bias-correction" flag.
               if(biascor .ne. 0) then the flct velocities are "bias corrected"
               by attempting to correct for the fact that the gaussian window
               function is the same for both the initial and final images,
               resulting in a velocity under-estimate using the standard
               FLCT algorithm.

verbose:       (input) integer*4 variable, the verbosity flag.  
               If (verbose .eq. 0) then flct messages to stdout are suppressed.

PURPOSE:  To use local-correlation tracking to find a 2D velocity field from
          two images separated slightly in time.  The images are assumed to
          be in Plate Carree coordinates (equally spaced in longitude and
          latitude).  The images are interpolated to a Mercator grid, flct
          is run, and the velocities are interpolated back to a Plate Carree
          grid, with a cos(latitude) modulation of the velocity amplitude.
          The interpolation method used is cubic convolution.
          Call from Fortran.

USAGE:    call flct_pc_f77(transp,f1,f2,nx,ny,deltat,deltas,sigma,
               vx,vy,vm,thresh,absflag,filter,kr,skip,poffset,qoffset,

transp:        (input)  integer*4 variable indicating whether input images 
               are stored in column-major (1st index varies fastest) or 
               row-major (2nd index varies fastest) order.  Typically, 2D-images
               constructed in IDL or Fortran are stored in column-major order.
               If (transp .eq. 0) then row-major order is assumed, but if
               (transp .eq. 1) column major order is assumed.  From a fortran
               program, you will probably want to set transp=1.

f1:            (input) real*8 2D array dimensioned (nx,ny)
               containing the first of the images to be operated on by the 
               flct function.

               flct function.

nx:            (input) integer*4 variable containing the number of pixels in 
               x direction across the image

ny:            (input) integer*4 variable containing the number of pixels in 
               y direction across the image

deltat:        (input) real*8 variable set to the time between images

deltas:        (input) real*8 variable set to the distance across one edge
               of a pixel

sigma:         (input) real*8 variable set to the Gaussian windowing function
               parameter used to localize regions of the image near a given 
               pixel.  Sigma is measured in pixels.  If sigma is set to 0, 
               then flct returns a whole frame shift, rather than a 2-D 
               velocity field.

vx:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing the x-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one value
               of vx is computed.

vy:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing the y-component of the velocity, measured in 
               units of deltas/deltat.  If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one value
               of vy is computed.

vm:            (output) real*8 array of dimension (nx,ny)
               containing a mask, set to 0 if no velocity was computed, 
               and set to 0.5 if the velocity was interpolated.  
               If (sigma .eq. 0.) then only one value of vm is returned.
               Note that because flct_pc_f77 uses interpolation, no value
               of 1.0 is ever returned into vm from flct_pc.

thresh:        (input) real*8 variable of the image threshold, where no
               estimate of the velocity will be done if the absolute value of
               the average image value is less than thresh.  If thresh is
               between 0 and 1, then the threshold is assumed to be in units
               relative to the maximum absolute value (unless absflag .ne. 0).

absflag:       (input) integer*4 variable:  If (absflag .ne. 0) and 
               thresh is between 0 and 1, then thresh is regarded as an 
               absolute limit, rather a relative limit.

filter:        (input) integer*4 flag variable:  If (filter .ne. 0) then high
               frequency spatial components of the images are attenuated by a

               the images.  Smaller values of kr result in stronger filtering.
               We have found useful values are in the range 0.25 to 0.5.  Values
               of kr larger than 1.0 typically have little effect, and values 
               0.1 and smaller typically result in too much filtering.

               skipping is done.  Setting skip to 2 means to skip every other

               when working with very large images, and also where interpolation
               is done (see discussion of "interpolate" below).  If flct_pc_f77
               is called with a non-zero value of skip, you must also set
               interpolate to a non-zero value.

poffset:       (input) integer*4 variable specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the x-direction if skipping is invoked.

qoffset:       (input) integer*4 variable specifying initial offset in 
               pixels in the y-direction if skipping is invoked.

interpolate:   (input) integer*4 variable, the interpolate flag.  If skip is 
               non-zero, and if (interpolate .ne. 0) the
               velocities at the skipped pixels are interpolated by using

               mask array vm is set to 0.5 at the locations where the velocity 
               components are interpolated.

latmin:        (input) real*8 value of the minimum latitude of the images, 
               in radians.

               in radians.

biascor:       (input) integer*4 variable, the "bias-correction" flag.
